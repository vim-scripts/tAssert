This plugin defines a command |:TAssert| that takes an expression as 
argument and throws an exception if this expression evaluates to 
|empty()|. You can insert these comments throughout your code whenever 
something could potentially go wrong. The exception is then thrown right 
where the problem occurs. You could think of it as a poor man's 
design-by-contract substitute.

One goal of this plugin is to allow users to quickly switch on or off 
assertions depending on the context. This can be done either by:

    1. Turning assertions off so that they are not evaluated. This can 
       be achieved by setting g:TASSERT to 0 or by calling the command 
       |:TAssertOff|.

    2. Commenting out assertions in the current buffer by calling the 
       commmand |:TAssertComment|.


Example:

    fun! Test(a, b)
        TAssertType a:a, 'string'
        TAssertType a:b, 'number'
        TAssert !empty(a:a)
        return repeat(a:a, a:b)
    endf


Logging:

TAssert also includes a few convenience commands for logging. The 
variable g:TLOG controls where messages are written to:

    echom ... Print messages in the echo area.
    file  ... Print messages to a file; syntax "file:FILENAME"
    Decho ... Print messages via Decho (vimscript#642)
